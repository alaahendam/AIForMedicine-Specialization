The solution to weekly challenges are my own work. You should **never** submit the work in this repository as your own work to pass the course. 

This repository is for learning purpose only. Solutions provided in this repository are my attempt to come up with my own ideas to solve the challenges posed throughout the course. One is more than welcome to explore my solutions and benefit from the new ideas if any.

Star ‚≠ê this page to follow my updates.
Thank you.
